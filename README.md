# Angular Seed Project v0.0.1

Welcome to my AngularJS Seed project. As you can see this is still under heavy development (v0.0.1) and isn't ready for users to clone, install and use.

It is still a great reference for ideas on setting up a large AngularJS application of your own.

When this project is complete it will contain a AngularJS user interface with public areas, member areas where users must be logged in, and an admin area where administrative users can manage data saved in the app database.
